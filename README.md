## üìò Database Schema

The application uses a MySQL database. The full schema can be found in the [database_schema.sql](assets/database/database_schema.sql) file.

Here's a brief overview of the main tables:

- `userdata`: Stores user account information
- `roles`: Stores user account information
- `meal`: Contains details about individual meals
- `category`: Associates meals with users and dates
- `measure`: Manages shopping lists for users
- `meal_description`: Stores individual items in shopping lists
- `ingredient`: Stores individual items in shopping lists

You can also view the ER diagram of the database schema [here](assets/database/entity_relationship_diagram.png).
